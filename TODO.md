# TODO

- [x] Break `src/websearch/agent.py` into smaller modules (config, graph wiring, nodes) while preserving behavior.
- [ ] Ensure translation and language detection helpers have dedicated tests.
- [ ] Update configuration wiring to surface pivot/backoff defaults cleanly.
- [ ] Refresh pytest suite and add coverage for new module boundaries.
